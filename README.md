## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

<li>4.Fertilizer & Irrigation Advisor

Feature: Personalized dosage schedules for fertilizer & water.

Benefit: Farmers save 30–40% on input costs and protect soil health.</li>
<li>5. Harvesting Time Predictor

Feature: AI tool predicts the best time to harvest (based on weather + crop maturity).

Benefit: Reduces grain loss and ensures maximum market price.</li>
<li>6.Pest & Disease Doctor

Feature: Farmers upload photo of leaves/plants → AI diagnoses pest/disease.

Benefit: Quick treatment saves 15–20% crops each season.</li>
<li>7.Market & Buyer Connect

Feature: Shows real-time mandi prices + connects farmers directly with nearby & distant buyers (wholesalers, exporters).

Benefit: Farmers sell at the best price without being exploited by middlemen.</li>
<li>8.Reminders & Alerts

Feature: Push notifications for weather, irrigation, fertilizer, pest risks, and market updates.

Benefit: Farmers don’t miss critical actions → ensures timely farming decisions.</li>
<li>9.Community & Schemes Access

Feature: Access to govt. schemes, subsidies, and NGO programs in their area.

Benefit: Farmers get financial support and resources they often miss.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Innovation</h1>
<p>The innovation made is not some regular greater accessibility and adoption across rural areas it is a  change of pace made for farmers of our country to yield a more profitable growth than those years  where there were no technologies,our innovation Saves 15–20% of crops,and makes faster action,Reduces crop loss, ensures timely harvest</p>
